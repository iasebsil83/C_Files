This program is a simple utility library that will allow you to manipulate file
a little bit easier than stdio.h does.

A demonstration program is made in prog.c.

More informations about this library are available in files.h.

DISCLAIMER : This program is not a substitute of stdio.h but a complement.
             stdio.h gives a lot of options on file management, files.h is a way much simpler.
